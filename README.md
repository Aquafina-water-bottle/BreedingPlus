# BreedingPlus
A minecraft plugin that gives a percent chance to create a spawn egg instead of a baby when breeding

Why the hell is the main directory inside a folder with the same name? Because I'm superb at using github, that's why. Get on my level. 

No, this plugin probably doesn't work yet. I'm just putting it here in case my computer gets smashed with a wrecking ball and then gets eaten by a shark, of which the metal parts will not properly go through the shark's digestive system and is left to rot inside the intestines of a soon-to-be dead shark.

On a serious note, it needs additional testing and javadocs that are slightly more complete. Also, I actually need to move the folder outside of itself.
