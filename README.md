I just realized that the javadocs makes this repository seem like this is just a huge dump of html code. That's just fabulous.

## Q & A
Q: Why the hell is the main directory inside a folder with the same name?

A: Because I'm superb at using github, that's why. Get on my level.

Q: Was this entire section created just for that one question above this, even if there are actual valid questions that should be put here for the sake of user friendliness?

A: Yes.
