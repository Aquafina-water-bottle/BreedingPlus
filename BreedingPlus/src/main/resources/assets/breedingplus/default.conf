# Level 0 will not output anything.
# Level 1 will output everything at the debug level, meaning you would have to go to the log file to see the output.
# Level 2 will output everything at the info level, meaning you can see the output in the console in normal (white) text.
# Level 3 will output everything at the warn level, meaning you can see the output in the console in yellow text.
# The value is set to 0 to prevent unnecessary logging.
